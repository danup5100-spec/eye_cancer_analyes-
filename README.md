# eye_cancer_analyes-
This project analyzes **5,000 patient records** of eye cancer cases to explore demographic patterns, treatment effectiveness, genetic impacts, and survival outcomes.  
It uses **Python, SQL, statistical testing, and data visualization** to uncover actionable healthcare insights.

Objectives--
- Identify **age, gender, and geographical patterns** in eye cancer cases.
- Evaluate **treatment effectiveness** (chemotherapy, surgery, radiation) on survival time.
- Assess the impact of **genetic markers** (e.g., BRAF mutation) on patient outcomes.
- Visualize findings through clear, interactive charts.
